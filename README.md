As a student double major in CSE and Informatics, I want to see the structure of each class, so that I won’t make the mistake of taking 3 project-based classes in one quarter and balance out my schedule with courses from both schools.

As a newly admitted informatics student, I want to be able to see other informatics students’ opinion on classes so I can draw my own conclusion of which classes to take. I want it to be accessible so everyone could give feedback on a particular class

As a freshman, I want to explore different majors especially informatics, so that I can make up my mind on what I want to learn and do in the future.

As a high school student, I want to take some college level classes during this summer break. I want to find a class that has the best reviews in my city.
